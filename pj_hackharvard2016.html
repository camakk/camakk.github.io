    <h2><b>HackHarvard 2016, the second annual HackHarvard Hackathon event</b></h2>
    <p>
      The second ever HackHarvard event was held from October 21-23, 2016 at the Harvard Student Organization Center at Hilles, or the SOCH.  There were 551 attendees who checked in as well as over 80 projects submitted.  We accepted people from 33 U.S. States and 23 foreign countries.  Teams of 1-4 students worked for 36 hours (Friday 9pm to Sunday 9am) to build unique projects incorporating computer science and emerging technologies.

      The above are a collection of promotional materials and media features I've been involved in as a part of HackHarvard.  The PuddleScope feature specifically focuses on the philosophy that drives our HackHarvard organizing team.  That article is particularly nice because it gets to the core of what I believe is the best approach to managing the HackHarvard team.

    <p>
      Mentors from sponsor companies like Microsoft, Capital One, Akamai, and Bloomberg were available to help students on their projects.  The entire event was planned and hosted by an organizing team of 25 members.  I was one of four directors who set the agenda and drove tasks to completion for our team.  I primarily dealt with tasks involving (1)internal team organization, (2) venue rental and communications, (3) email communications with partners, (4) recruitment of new team members, (5) budget, and (6) crisis escalation at the event itself.  In short, it was something of a <b>hybrid CEO/CFO role</b> that took up a significant amount of my time through Summer and Fall 2016.  In the sections below, I'll outline the roles I performed on the team as well as what I've found to be the best methods to take care of these tasks.
    </p>
    <h2> 1 Reorganizing HackHarvard</h2>
    <p>
      In early February 2016, HackHarvard was a small, small organization.  Our November 2015 had exhausted our small organizing staff (see 2015 article here) and there were only 7 returning members forming the HackHarvard 2016 team.
    </p>
    <h2> 2 Venue Rental and Communications</h2>
    <p>
      I believe the best way to get things done is to go and do them. After our 2015 event, we were looking for a new venue. The main benefit of the Harvard Science Center was that it was big - aside from that, it had few other qualities that made it suitable for a hackathon. Instead of tables for attendees to work at, it only had lecture halls. It was not a private space - graduate students and professors taught review sessions and class sections only rooms over from where hackers were working.  One of our number one priorities was to find a better space for our 2016 event so we would not be relegated to the Science Center once more. It's a nice venue - just not great for hackathons.
    </p>
    <h2> 3 hackharvard@gmail.com (and all derivatives)</h2>
    <p>
      One major shortcoming of our initial 2015 event was the number of unread emails we had leading up to the event. We did not designate an individual to control the email account - as a result, we missed out on emails from potential partners, were unable to answer attendee questions, and in general fell out of touch with the primary means of communication HackHarvard had with the public.  I sought to change that for 2016 by building a framework for responding to emails to the HackHarvard account.
