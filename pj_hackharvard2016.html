    <h2><b>HackHarvard 2016, the second annual HackHarvard Hackathon event</b></h2>
    <p>
      The second ever HackHarvard event was held from October 21-23, 2016 at the Harvard Student Organization Center at Hilles, or the SOCH.  There were 551 attendees who checked in as well as over 80 projects submitted.  We accepted people from 33 U.S. States and 23 foreign countries.  Teams of 1-4 students worked for 36 hours (Friday 9pm to Sunday 9am) to build unique projects incorporating computer science and emerging technologies. Mentors from sponsor companies like Microsoft, Capital One, Akamai, and Bloomberg were available to help students on their projects.

      The above are a collection of promotional materials and media features I've been involved in as a part of HackHarvard.  The PuddleScope feature specifically focuses on the philosophy that drives our HackHarvard organizing team.  That article is particularly nice because it gets to the core of what I believe is the best approach to managing the HackHarvard team.
    </p>



    <p>
      The entire event was planned and hosted by an organizing team of 25 members.  I was one of four directors who set the agenda and drove tasks to completion for our team.  I primarily dealt with tasks involving (1) internal team organization, (2) budget, and (3) escalation at the event itself.  In short, it was something of a <b>hybrid CEO/CFO role</b> that took up a significant amount of my time through Summer and Fall 2016.  In the sections below, I'll outline the roles I performed on the team as well as what I've found to be the best methods to take care of these tasks.
    </p>
    <h2> Reorganizing HackHarvard</h2>
    <p>
      In early February 2016, HackHarvard was a small, small organization.  After our first ever November 2015 event, there were only 7 returning members. We all knew eachother and could go about building the club the way we wanted to build it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first year, we had three official teams - logistics, sponsorship, and hacker relations. In our reorg, we renamed sponsorship to partnership (to include finding talks and workshops as well as corporate sponsors) and added a fourth team, Design. As director, my role was to manage an organizing team of 25 individual broken down into four sub-commitees (Logistics, Partnerships, Hacker Relations, Design).
    </p>
    <div class="w3-row">
      <div class="w3-col w3-padding s12 m12 l10">
        <img class="w3-image" src="./img/hackharvard2016/img1.jpg" alt="hh org structure">
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      The Logistics commitee handles anything to do with the three  days of the event itself, including food, transportation, schedule, room reservations, etc.  They work closely with Hacker Relations which handles all attendee-related functions including our official website, marketing, application review/acceptance, social media, and attendee questions. Partnerships is the back-end team that mostly handles corporate sponsorships, mentors, judges, and other non-attendee external relations.  And design is the final team who's job is supplemental to the other teams, in that they design the visuals for our email communications, the visuals for the website, and any on-site banners/signs at the hackathon event.
    </p><p>
      These four teams are supplemented by one management team which we refer to as the "core" team internally.  Externally, these four are known as our directors.  Other than the directors, all the other members are known as managers. The HackHarvard leadership structure is extremely flat and only has these two tiers - managers report to directors. When the hackathon occurs, we have a number of volunteers just for the weekend - those people report directly to our managers.
    </p><p>
      I played a major part in designing this leadership structure after experiencing frustration with the leadership structures of other student clubs.  Most other large Harvard clubs follow a four-tier leadership structure - at the top you have co-presidents, the senior executive board, other leadership roles, then associates. What I've found is that in this leadership structure, the top and bottom of the leadership structure end up doing everything; the president is responsible for the success of the club, so he or she is invested. The associates are typically freshmen so they want to contribute in hopes of moving up.  The middle tiers (senior executive board and other leadership) more often than not don't end up doing anything.
    </p>
    <div class="w3-row">
      <div class="w3-col w3-padding s12 m12 l6">
        <img class="w3-image" src="./img/hackharvard2016/img2.jpg" alt="traditional leadership structure">
      </div>
      <div class="w3-col w3-padding s12 m12 l6">
        <img class="w3-image" src="./img/hackharvard2016/img3.jpg" alt="hh leadership structure">
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      This hurts the club president(s) because they end up doing an obscene amount of work.  This hurts the associate (freshmen) members because they want to contribute, but don't get real leadership roles where they can make decisions until they are older.  The ideal system spreads around the responsibility of the club president while empowering associate-level members by giving them positions of responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      The improved HackHarvard leadership structure makes everyone genuinely feel like part of the organization.  As soon as a member is brought into HackHarvard, they are a member of the board and they have just as much right to make decisions as every other member of the team. Our team honors those who can get things done and there are no "deadbeat" leadership positions. As a result, we pick up smart people early on because we are willing to invest in them as a club.  There's no "working your way up": there's only showing your worth once you're part of the club.  The previous year's directors choose the next year's directors and choose based off of who are the greatest contributors/leaders from the previous year.
    </p>
    <p>
      This organizational structure poses no barriers to any members of the organization looking to contribute - directorships can be earned by anybody and we treat every member of the team equally to maximize our output as a club and minimize bureaucracy.
    </p>

    <h2> HackHarvard Financial Management </h2>
    <p>
      Our initial 2015 event was very disorganized financially. There was no written budget - the budget was chalked up as a bunch of rough categories determined at meetings.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have no formal education in finance and accounting, but I knew we would need better organization of our budget/financials if we were to be a successful club into the future.
    </p>


    <!--
    <h2> hackharvard@gmail.com (and all derivatives)</h2>
    <p>
      One major shortcoming of our initial 2015 event was the number of unread emails we had leading up to the event. We did not designate an individual to control the email account - as a result, we missed out on emails from potential partners, were unable to answer attendee questions, and in general fell out of touch with the primary means of communication HackHarvard had with the public.  This was high on our list of priorities for things to fix for 2016.
